            <p> As a dedicated member of the Rotary Club, I have made significant contributions in my roles.I have actively contributed to the Rotary Club by organizing and hosting joint sessions with other Rotary clubs.

            <h3>Talent Search Campaign</h3>
            <p>In Ethiopia, I have taken the initiative to organize a yearly talent search campaign specifically tailored for teenagers. This campaign, held during the summer, aims to discover and nurture the unique talents and abilities of young Ethiopian students. By providing a platform for aspiring teenagers to showcase their skills, whether in the arts, sports, academics, or other areas of interest, the talent search campaign promotes personal growth, self-confidence, and celebrates the rich talent within Ethiopia's youth.</p>
            <p>As part of the talent search campaign in Ethiopia, we go beyond simply providing a platform for teenagers to showcase their talents. We recognize the immense value of mentorship and learning from successful experts in various fields. Therefore, we make it a point to invite accomplished professionals and experts to participate in the campaign. These experts, who have achieved success in their respective fields, are invited to share their experiences, insights, and wisdom with the participating youth.
                By bringing in these successful experts, we create a unique opportunity for the youth to engage directly with established professionals. They have the chance to communicate, ask questions, and gain valuable guidance that can shape their own paths to success. This interaction fosters a sense of inspiration and motivation, as the young participants are exposed to real-life stories of achievement and are able to learn from those who have already walked the path they aspire to follow.
                The presence of these successful experts adds an extra layer of significance to the talent search campaign in Ethiopia. It not only allows the youth to showcase their talents but also creates a platform for meaningful mentorship and knowledge exchange. By connecting aspiring teenagers with accomplished professionals, we foster a supportive environment where the youth can learn, grow, and be inspired to reach their full potential.</p>

            <h3> Professional support</h3>
            <p> As the owner of a tech company in Ethiopia, I am passionate about supporting organizations that provide assistance to the elderly, such as "Mekedoniya." Through my company, I offer free services in website design and database maintenance to help enhance their operations and outreach efforts.
                Understanding the vital role of online presence in today's digital era, my team of skilled web designers and developers collaborate closely with "Mekedoniya" to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website. We work together to understand their specific needs and goals, ensuring that the website effectively communicates their mission, services, and support for the elderly community. By incorporating intuitive navigation, accessible design, and relevant content, we aim to create a website that fosters connectivity, provides valuable information, and encourages engagement.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we provide ongoing support in maintaining and updating the website's database. This includes managing and organizing data related to "Mekedoniya's" programs, resources, and volunteer opportunities. By implementing efficient database management systems, we help ensure the accurate storage and retrieval of information, enabling "Mekedoniya" to streamline their operations and better serve the elderly individuals they support.
                By offering these services free of charge to "Mekedoniya," we aim to empower them with the technological tools necessary to amplify their impact on the elderly community. We understand the importance of their work in providing care, assistance, and a supportive environment for the elderly population. Through our collaboration, we strive to enhance their visibility, expand their reach, and facilitate meaningful connections with potential beneficiaries, volunteers, and donors.
                extending our support to other helping organizations as well. We recognize the importance of embracing technology to amplify the impact of such organizations and enhance their ability to serve their respective communities.</p>
